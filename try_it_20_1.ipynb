    "### Comparing Aggregate Models for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This try-it focuses on utilizing ensemble models in a regression setting.  Much like you have used individual classification estimators to form an ensemble of estimators -- here your goal is to explore ensembles for regression models.  As with your earlier assignment, you will use scikitlearn to carry out the ensembles using the `VotingRegressor`.   \n",

    "#### Dataset and Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, a dataset containing census information on individuals and their hourly wage is loaded using the `fetch_openml` function.  OpenML is another repository for datasets [here](https://www.openml.org/).  Your task is to use ensemble methods to explore predicting the `wage` column of the data.  Your ensemble should at the very least consider the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LinearRegression` -- perhaps you even want the `TransformedTargetRegressor` here.\n",
    "- `KNeighborsRegressor`\n",
    "- `DecisionTreeRegressor`\n",
    "- `Ridge`\n",
    "- `SVR`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tune the `VotingRegressor` to try to optimize the prediction performance and determine if the wisdom of the crowd performed better in this setting than any of the individual models themselves.  Report back on your findings and discuss the interpretability of your findings.  Is there a way to determine what features mattered in predicting wages?"
